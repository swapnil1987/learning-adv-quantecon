# Introduction


There are too many excellent resources for Quantitative Economics (QE). I am not trying to add one more to it. My objective is just to create a place where I keep an index of QE which I find interesting and which have helped me in this journey. And meanwhile, if someone finds it helpful, no one can be more happy than me!
